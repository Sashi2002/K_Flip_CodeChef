# K_Flip_CodeChef

Problem

Chef is given a binary string SS of length NN.

In one operation, Chef has to choose exactly KK indices and flip their values.

Chef can perform the above operation any number of times. Find the number of distinct binary strings Chef can obtain.

Since the answer might be large, output it module 10^9 + 710 
9
 +7.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK, as mentioned in statement.
The next line contains the binary string SS.

Output Format

For each test case, output the number of distinct binary strings Chef can obtain, modulo 10^9 + 710 
9
 +7.
